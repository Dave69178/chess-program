# Inspiration
I wanted a new project to take on to expand my programming knowledge and to gain more experience in managing larger projects.

This seemed like a natural progression from the rudimentary Noughts and Crosses application and AI I'd previously made, althought maybe a slightly large step in terms of knowledge and project management.

I took inpiration from Sebastian Lague's Coding Adventure video, a great watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk&ab_channel=SebastianLague.

# "Features"
As of writing this (9/5/22) the fundamentals have been laid (board representation, graphics and logic have been completed, albiet to a minimum level).
I need to run some debugging tests to ensure that all possible moves are legal and that the rules are represented correctly.

I plan to add a menu screen with options for playing against AI or 2 player, as well as playing as black or white.

An initial random 'AI' has been implemented as a test, with a more involved version to come.

# Comments
The main purpose of this was to create a working project - efficiency is something that I next need to work on.
The infrastructure is inefficient. I had no real clue going into this how to organise a unity project and/or a chess engine.

I will be happy to put this project to bed once game settings can be selected, and there is a respectable AI in place.

Before this project I had no experience of C#, unity or chess programming. I may have bitten off more than I can chew, but I'm glad I stuck with it.

If you have no idea how to play chess, then this may be the opponent for you.
